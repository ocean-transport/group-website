	Abstract = {Abstract We investigate the role of small-scale, high-frequency motions on lateral transport in the ocean, by using velocity fields and particle trajectories from an ocean general circulation model (MITgcm-llc4320) that permits submesoscale flows, inertia-gravity waves, and tides. Temporal averaging/filtering removes most of the submesoscale turbulence, inertia-gravity waves, and tides, resulting in a largely geostrophic flow, with a rapid drop-off in energy at scales smaller than the mesoscales. We advect two types of Lagrangian particles: (a) 2-D particles (surface restricted) and (b) 3-D particles (advected in full three dimensions) with the filtered and unfiltered velocities and calculate Lagrangian diagnostics. At large length/time scales, Lagrangian diffusivity is comparable for filtered and unfiltered velocities, while at short scales, unfiltered velocities disperse particles much faster. We also calculate diagnostics of Lagrangian coherent structures:rotationally coherent Lagrangian vortices detected from closed contours of the Lagrangian-averaged vorticity deviation and material transport barriers formed by ridges of maximum finite-time Lyapunov exponent. For temporally filtered velocities, we observe strong material coherence, which breaks down when the level of temporal filtering is reduced/removed, due to vigorous small-scale mixing. In addition, for the lowest temporal resolution, the 3-D particles experience very little vertical motion, suggesting that degrading temporal resolution greatly reduces vertical advection by high-frequency motions. Our study suggests that Lagrangian diagnostics based on satellite-derived surface geostrophic velocity fields, even with higher spatial resolutions as in the upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission, may overestimate the presence of mesoscale coherent structures and underestimate dispersion.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Mesoscale eddies stir along the neutral plane, and the resulting neutral diffusion is a fundamental aspect of subgrid-scale tracer transport in ocean models. Calculating neutral diffusion traditionally involves calculating neutral slopes and three-dimensional tracer gradients. The calculation of the neutral slope traditionally occurs by computing the ratio of the horizontal to vertical locally referenced potential density derivative. However, this approach is problematic in regions of weak vertical stratification, prompting the use of a variety of ad hoc regularization methods that can lead to rather nonphysical dependencies for the resulting neutral tracer gradients. Here we use a VErtical Non-local Method ``VENM,'' a search algorithm that requires no ad hoc regularization and significantly improves the numerical accuracy of calculating neutral slopes, neutral tracer gradients, and associated neutral diffusive fluxes. We compare and contrast VENM against a more traditional method, using an independent objective neutrality condition combined with estimates of spurious diffusion, heat transport, and water mass transformation rates. VENM is more accurate, both physically and numerically, and should form the basis for future efforts involving neutral diffusion calculations from observations and possibly numerical model simulations.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The surface kinetic energy of a 1/48$\,^{\circ}$ global ocean simulation and its distribution as a function of frequency and location are compared with the one estimated from 15,329 globally distributed surface drifter observations at hourly resolution. These distributions follow similar patterns with a dominant low-frequency component and well-defined tidal and near-inertial peaks globally. Quantitative differences are identified with deficits of low-frequency energy near the equator (factor 2) and at near-inertial frequencies (factor 3) and an excess of energy at semidiurnal frequencies (factor 4) for the model. Owing to its hourly resolution and its near-global spatial coverage, the array of surface drifters is an invaluable tool to evaluate the realism of tide-resolving high-resolution ocean simulations used in observing system simulation experiments. Sources of bias between model and drifter data are discussed, and associated leads for future work highlighted.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Climate models often parameterize isopycnal mixing by mesoscale eddies using a diffusion operator that acts in the isopycnal direction, multiplied by an isopycnal-mixing coefficient. The magnitude of this coefficient is uncertain, with observational estimates ranging from 10 to 10,000 m2/s. In an idealized-geometry ocean model, the isopycnal-mixing coefficient is varied across a similar range without allowing the circulation to change: This leads to large changes in the ventilation of the deep ocean. Passive tracers are used to assess the impact of varying the isopycnal-mixing coefficient on water mass distributions. Increasing the isopycnal-mixing coefficient from 50 to 5,000 m2/s leads to a 63\% reduction in the amount of North Atlantic Deep Water and a doubling in the amount of Antarctic Bottom Water in the deep Pacific ocean. This change is associated with a 700-yr reduction in the ideal age of water in the deep Pacific ocean.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Biological productivity in the Southern Ocean is limited by iron availability. Previous studies of iron supply have focused on mixed-layer entrainment and diapycnal fluxes. However, the Southern Ocean is a region highly energetic mesoscale and submesoscale turbulence. Here we investigate the role of eddies in supplying iron to the euphotic zone, using a flat-bottom zonally re-entrant model, configured to represent the Antarctic Circumpolar Current region, that is coupled to a biogeochemical model with a realistic seasonal cycle. Eddies are admitted or suppressed by changing the model's horizontal resolution. We utilize cross spectral analysis and the generalized Omega equation to temporally and spatially decompose the vertical transport attributable to mesoscale and submesoscale motions. Our results suggest that the mesoscale vertical fluxes provide a first-order pathway for transporting iron across the mixing-layer base, where diapycnal mixing is weak, and must be included in modeling the open-Southern Ocean iron budget.},

	Abstract = {Abstract An idealized eddy-resolving ocean basin, closely resembling the North Pacific Ocean, is simulated using MITgcm. We identify rotationally coherent Lagrangian vortices (RCLVs) and sea surface height (SSH) eddies based on the Lagrangian and Eulerian framework, respectively. General statistical results show that RCLVs have a much smaller coherent core than SSH eddies with the ratio of radius is about 0.5. RCLVs are often enclosed by SSH anomaly contours, but SSH eddy identification method fails to detect more than half of RCLVs. Based on their locations, two types of eddies are classified into three categories: overlapping RCLVs and SSH eddies, nonoverlapping SSH eddies, and nonoverlapping RCLVs. Using Lagrangian particles, we examine the processes of leakage and intrusion around SSH eddies. For overlapping SSH eddies, over the lifetime, the material coherent core only accounts for about 25\% and about 50\% of initial water leak from eddy interior. The remaining 25\% of water can still remain inside the boundary, but only in the form of filaments outside the coherent core. For nonoverlapping SSH eddies, more water leakage (about 60\%) occurs at a faster rate. Guided by the number and radius of SSH eddies, fixed circles and moving circles are randomly selected to diagnose the material flux around these circles. We find that the leakage and intrusion trends of moving circles are quite similar to that of nonoverlapping SSH eddies, suggesting that the material coherence properties of nonoverlapping SSH eddies are not significantly different from random pieces of ocean with the same size.},

Many previous studies have characterized the spring bloom using chlorophyll estimates from satellite ocean color observations. Assumptions regarding the chlorophyll-to-carbon ratio within phytoplankton and vertical structure of biogeochemical variables lead to uncertainty in satellite-based estimates of phytoplankton carbon biomass. Here, we revisit the characterizations of the bloom using optical backscatter from biogeochemical floats deployed by the Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling and Southern Ocean and Climate Field Studies with Innovative Tools projects. In particular, by providing a three-dimensional view of the seasonal cycle, we are able to identify basin-wide bloom characteristics corresponding to physical features; biomass is low in Ekman downwelling regions north of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current region and high within and south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.},

	Abstractnote = {<p>Variation in upper ocean temperature is a critical factor in understanding global climate variability. Similarly, knowledge of temperature variability in specific ocean regions is crucial to understanding global and regional climate change. The processes controlling regional variations in ocean heat content (forcing, advection and mixing) differ in relevance depending on region and time scale. In the present study, temperature anomaly budgets were described using the ECCOv4 ocean state estimate to describe the balance between atmospheric forcing and ocean transport mechanisms for different basins and oceanic regions and at varying temporal and spatial resolutions. Considering the area-integrated budget for the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Ocean basins, anomalies in temperature tendency are driven by atmospheric forcing (i.e., sea surface heating). When the contributions of budget terms are spatially resolved, there is a latitudinal pattern where the advection term is most important towards the equator, while forcing becomes increasingly relevant at higher latitudes. However, there are also basin-specific differences affecting which term governs regional budgets. Once sub-basin variation is resolved, the balance between heat budget terms is not particularly sensitive to the scale of spatial aggregation at which the budget is determined. Temporal aggregation shows that atmospheric forcing is more important at short timescales, while at long timescales advection becomes the principal term that determines variability. The linearization of the advective term illustrates that ocean heat variability is due to anomalies in circulation, while anomalies in temperature fields effect focused regions and become more relevant on interannual timescales.</p>},

	Abstract = { AbstractRotationally coherent Lagrangian vortices (RCLVs) are identified from satellite-derived surface geostrophic velocities in the eastern Pacific (180$\,^{\circ}$--130$\,^{\circ}$W) using the objective (frame invariant) finite-time Lagrangian coherent structure detection method of Haller et al. based on the Lagrangian-averaged vorticity deviation. RCLVs are identified for 30-, 90-, and 270-day intervals over the entire satellite dataset, beginning in 1993. In contrast to structures identified using Eulerian eddy-tracking methods, the RCLVs maintain material coherence over the specified time intervals, making them suitable for material transport estimates. Statistics of RCLVs are compared to statistics of eddies identified from sea surface height (SSH) by Chelton et al. RCLVs and SSH eddies are found to propagate westward at similar speeds at each latitude, consistent with the Rossby wave dispersion relation. However, RCLVs are uniformly smaller and shorter-lived than SSH eddies. A coherent eddy diffusivity is derived to quantify the contribution of RCLVs to meridional transport; it is found that RCLVs contribute less than 1\% to net meridional dispersion and diffusion in this sector, implying that eddy transport of tracers is mostly due to incoherent motions, such as swirling and filamentation outside of the eddy cores, rather than coherent meridional translation of eddies themselves. These findings call into question prior estimates of coherent eddy transport based on Eulerian eddy identification methods. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Upwelling of northern deep waters in the Southern Ocean is fundamentally important for the closure of the global meridional overturning circulation and delivers carbon and nutrient-rich deep waters to the sea surface. We quantify water mass transformation along upwelling pathways originating in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific and ending at the surface of the Southern Ocean using Lagrangian trajectories in an eddy-permitting ocean state estimate. Recent related work shows that upwelling in the interior below about 400 m depth is localized at hot spots associated with major topographic features in the path of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, while upwelling through the surface layer is more broadly distributed. In the ocean interior upwelling is largely isopycnal; Atlantic and to a lesser extent Indian Deep Waters cool and freshen while Pacific deep waters are more stable, leading to a homogenization of water mass properties. As upwelling water approaches the mixed layer, there is net strong transformation toward lighter densities due to mixing of freshwater, but there is a divergence in the density distribution as Upper Circumpolar Deep Water tends become lighter and dense Lower Circumpolar Deep Water tends to become denser. The spatial distribution of transformation shows more rapid transformation at eddy hot spots associated with major topography where density gradients are enhanced; however, the majority of cumulative density change along trajectories is achieved by background mixing. We compare the Lagrangian analysis to diagnosed Eulerian water mass transformation to attribute the mechanisms leading to the observed transformation.},

@article{TesdalEtAl2018,
	Abstract = { AbstractExamination of a range of salinity products collectively suggests widespread freshening of the North Atlantic from the mid-2000s to the present. Monthly salinity fields reveal negative trends that differ in magnitude and significance between western and eastern regions of the North Atlantic. These differences can be attributed to the large negative interannual excursions in salinity in the western subpolar gyre and the Labrador Sea, which are not apparent in the central or eastern subpolar gyre. This study demonstrates that temporal trends in salinity in the northwest (including the Labrador Sea) are subject to mechanisms that are distinct from those responsible for the salinity trends in the central and eastern North Atlantic. In the western subpolar gyre a negative correlation between near-surface salinity and the circulation strength of the subpolar gyre suggests that negative salinity anomalies are connected to an intensification of the subpolar gyre, which is causing increased flux of freshwater from the East Greenland Current and subsequent transport into the Labrador Sea during the melting season. Analyses of sea surface wind fields suggest that the strength of the subpolar gyre is linked to the North Atlantic Oscillation-- and Arctic Oscillation--driven changes in wind stress curl in the eastern subpolar gyre. If this trend of decreasing salinity continues, it has the potential to enhance water column stratification, reduce vertical fluxes of nutrients, and cause a decline in biological production and carbon export in the North Atlantic Ocean. },
